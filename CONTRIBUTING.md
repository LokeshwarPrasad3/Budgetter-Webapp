## 1. Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: First, fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Budgetter-Webapp.git
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required packages for both frontend and backend.
   ```bash
    cd client
    npm install

    cd ../server
    npm install
    ```
4. **Run the App**: Start the development servers for both frontend and backend.
   ```bash
    cd server
    npm run dev

    cd ../client
    npm run dev
    ```

## 2. Coding Standards
*  **Code Style**: Use Prettier for formatting. Example configuration:
    ```bash
    {
    "semi": true,
    "singleQuote": true,
    "trailingComma": "es5",
    "tabWidth": 2
    }

    ```
*  **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for strict type-safety. Avoid *any* unless absolutely necessary.
*  **Naming Conventions**: 
    - Components and files should use PascalCase (e.g., *MyComponent.tsx* ).
    - Variables and functions should use camelCase.

## 2. Branch Naming Conventions
Please use the following branch naming convention:

*  **feature/feature-name**: For new features (e.g., 
 *feature/add-auth* ).
*  **fix/bug-description**: For bug fixes (e.g.,
 *fix/button-not-clickable* ).
*  **chore/description**: For maintenance tasks (e.g., 
 *chore/update-dependencies* ).

### Example Branch Naming

- feature/add-login
- fix/navbar-styling
- chore/refactor-code
